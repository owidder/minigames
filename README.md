## Minigames

This is a simple mobile browser based game made with Angular.js, d3 and browserify

(The repo is based on [angular-gulp-browserify-livereload-boilerplate](https://github.com/Hyra/angular-gulp-browserify-livereload-boilerplate)
from [Hyra](https://github.com/Hyra), [see also this great post from him](http://mindthecode.com/lets-build-an-angularjs-app-with-browserify-and-gulp/))

## Installation

    npm install -g gulp (if not already there)

    clone this repo

    checkout this branch

    npm install

    gulp watch
    
## dist and dev 

Now you 2 servers running

dev server (with a no-browserified version):

    http://localhost:5001/app/index-dev.html
    
dist server (with a browserified version):

    http://localhost:5000
